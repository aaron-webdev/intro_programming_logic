# print("Hello World")
# python uses the pound symbol to denote comments
# indentaion is how Python starts a new line

# firstName = "Mike"
# firstName = firstName + "Sally"
# quantity1 = 12
# listPrice = 12.99

# quant1 = 1000
# quant2 = 22
# print( quant1 * quant2)
# print( quant1 // quant2)

# counter = 0
# counter = counter + 1
# print(counter)
# counter += 1  # += is python's short hand for incrementing (++/ -- does not work in Python)
# print(counter)

# strings may have either double " or single ' quotes.  It is best to learn double quotes for consistency across other languages.
# f-string (easier than concatination)
# name = f"{lastName}, {firstName}"

# when adding string and numbers together use "str()" to make the number a string data type
# when using the print function, sep='' will add a given character between values of he variables
